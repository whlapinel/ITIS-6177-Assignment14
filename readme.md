This repo is essentially a clone of DreamFactory's Docker compose repo.

To create the DreamFactory API, I ran the container, then created an admin user and logged in as that user.

Then I viewed the API docs, and accessed the default SQLite API at localhost/api/v2/db. Screenshots are included
in the "screenshots" folder in this repo.
